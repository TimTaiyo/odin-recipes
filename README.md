# odin-recipes

In the first course of the Odin project I learned the most important basics around HTML. Among other things I learned HTML functions like tags, the basic framework (HTML boilerplate), how to create lists and much more.

Now I try to use these new skills in my first project. I also set myself the goal to document the entire course of the project with GIT. 

This is a simple HTML project (which will be reworked and made nicer looking after my CSS course).
